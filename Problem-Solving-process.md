# Project-5

  The first step in creating this project was to determine the organizational par of the project. It was decided that the best option would be to have one class, with the constructor be the main source of prodction. Then the first label and test field were made for the slider panel. Next, the slider was created using a JSlider and tick marks. A change listener was used to alter the hamming distance value based on the slider value. After this, the show stations button and station display box were created with the display box being within a JScroll pane.
